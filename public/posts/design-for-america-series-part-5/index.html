The visual identity that guided this achievement, along with other iconic federal programs of the era, represents a golden age of government design that we’ve seemingly lost.\nWhen considering the best in government design, I’m immediately drawn to the revolutionary federal design work of the 1960s and 70s. The National Parks Service arrowhead, the PBS logo, NASA’s mission patches, and Massimo Vignelli’s New York Subway system didn’t just look good. They solved complex communication problems with remarkable clarity and purpose.\nOver the decades, government design has evolved to meet new challenges and serve diverse constituencies. Today’s federal websites reflect this complexity, with agencies developing distinct approaches to serve their unique missions and audiences. While this has enabled specialized solutions, it raises interesting questions about how we might balance individual agency needs with the systematic design thinking that once unified federal communications.\nHistorical Excellence in Government Design The iconic National Parks Service arrowhead logo, a masterpiece of functional design\nThe PBS logo designed by Tom Geismar, exemplifying timeless simplicity\nWhat made these designs endure for decades? They shared key characteristics that offer valuable lessons for today’s digital government services:\nClarity over decoration: Every element served a purpose Function over form: Beauty emerged from solving problems, not applying trends Universal accessibility: Designed to work for everyone, everywhere Memorable simplicity: Complex ideas distilled to their essential elements Systematic thinking: Comprehensive standards that scaled across applications NASA mission patches represent the pinnacle of government design excellence\nThe 1976 NASA Graphics Standards Manual exemplified this systematic approach:\nThe 1976 NASA Graphics Standards Manual established comprehensive design principles that guided America’s space program\nThis wasn’t just a style guide. It was a philosophy of communication that prioritized precision, consistency, and functional beauty. Every typeface choice, color decision, and layout principle was deliberate and purposeful.\nFurther Reading on This Golden Era For deeper exploration of this remarkable period in American design:\nNixon, NASA, and How the Federal Government Got Design National Parks Service Design Legacy NASA Style Guide Documentation New York Subway Design History Federal Street Sign Standards I highly recommend exploring the Standards Manual website for comprehensive documentation of these design systems and their enduring influence.\nThe Evolution of Government Design Since this golden era, government design has evolved to address increasingly complex digital challenges. As agencies have developed specialized digital services, each has naturally created unique approaches to serve their distinct constituencies and missions. While this has enabled innovation and customization, it has also created opportunities to reconsider how systematic design principles might enhance both efficiency and citizen experience.\nToday’s Government Digital Innovation The current landscape of federal website design showcases remarkable innovation happening across government. Teams at agencies like 18F, the U.S. Digital Service, and within individual departments have pioneered user-centered design approaches, advanced accessibility standards, and cutting-edge digital services. Each site represents thoughtful work by dedicated professionals solving complex challenges for diverse communities.\nExamining these efforts together reveals both the significant progress being made and the exciting potential for even greater impact through more coordinated design principles:\nA sampling of current government website homepages shows the variety of design approaches: different color schemes, typography choices, navigation patterns, and visual hierarchies that reflect each agency’s individual priorities\nThe Opportunity for Systematic Design Each of these sites represents dedicated work by teams solving real problems for their communities. However, viewing them collectively highlights an opportunity: applying systematic design thinking to create more cohesive citizen experiences. Just as the unified visual principles of the Space Age enabled clear communication across complex missions, coordinated design standards could help citizens navigate government services more intuitively.\nWhen citizens move between government services, consistent interface patterns and visual languages could reduce cognitive load and create more seamless experiences. This isn’t about constraining agency innovation. Instead, it’s about establishing foundational principles that free teams to focus on their unique missions.\nThe Opportunity for Systematic Approach Moving toward more coordinated design principles offers significant benefits:\nImproved efficiency: Shared design solutions reduce redundant development across agencies Enhanced accessibility: Consistent patterns create more predictable experiences for users with disabilities Better citizen experience: Familiar interface conventions allow users to focus on their goals Strengthened government credibility: Professional consistency reinforces public confidence The dedication and innovation of today’s government design teams creates a strong foundation for the next evolution in civic design. Building on this excellent work, how might we channel the systematic thinking that put humans on the moon into digital platforms that serve millions of citizens daily?\nDesigning Government for the Digital Age The path forward builds on the excellent work already happening across government, from the U.S. Web Design System to innovative agency-specific solutions. It’s about applying the systematic thinking that made 1960s federal design legendary to support and amplify today’s digital innovations. Just as NASA’s visual standards enabled clear communication across complex missions, coordinated design principles could help today’s talented government design teams achieve even greater impact.\nPrinciples for Modern Government Design A new era of government design excellence would prioritize:\nTypography: Optimized for digital readability across devices and accessibility needs Spacing: Systematic and purposeful, creating clear information hierarchies Color: Functional and accessible, meeting WCAG standards while maintaining visual coherence Interaction patterns: Consistent, learnable behaviors that work across all government services Content strategy: Clear, plain-language communication that puts citizen needs first Performance: Fast, reliable experiences that work on any device or connection speed The Promise of Systematic Design Imagine if interacting with government services felt as intuitive and efficient as the design systems that guided America to the moon. Citizens could focus on their goals rather than deciphering interfaces. Government agencies could build on shared foundations to focus resources on their unique missions and specialized user needs. This collaborative approach could amplify the excellent work already happening across government, helping America become known for digital services that combine beauty with unprecedented functionality.\nWhat’s Next In the next installment of this series, I’ll explore concrete strategies for implementing a unified government design system that honors the best of our design heritage while meeting the demands of digital citizenship. We’ll examine how systematic design thinking can reduce costs, improve accessibility, and restore citizen confidence in government digital services.\nAbout this series: “Design for America” explores how systematic design thinking can transform government digital services, drawing lessons from the golden age of federal design to address modern challenges in civic technology.\nThis article was co-written with AI assistance to improve clarity and structure.\n",

<p>Each of these sites represents dedicated work by teams solving real problems for their communities. However, viewing them collectively highlights an opportunity: <strong>applying systematic design thinking</strong> to create more cohesive citizen experiences. Just as the unified visual principles of the Space Age enabled clear communication across complex missions, coordinated design standards could help citizens navigate government services more intuitively.</p>
<p>When citizens move between government services, consistent interface patterns and visual languages could reduce cognitive load and create more seamless experiences. This isn&rsquo;t about constraining agency innovation. Instead, it&rsquo;s about establishing foundational principles that free teams to focus on their unique missions.</p>

<p>Moving toward more coordinated design principles offers significant benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved efficiency</strong>: Shared design solutions reduce redundant development across agencies</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced accessibility</strong>: Consistent patterns create more predictable experiences for users with disabilities</li>
<li><strong>Better citizen experience</strong>: Familiar interface conventions allow users to focus on their goals</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened government credibility</strong>: Professional consistency reinforces public confidence</li>
</ul>
<p>The dedication and innovation of today&rsquo;s government design teams creates a strong foundation for the next evolution in civic design. Building on this excellent work, how might we channel the systematic thinking that put humans on the moon into digital platforms that serve millions of citizens daily?</p>

<p>The path forward builds on the excellent work already happening across government, from the U.S. Web Design System to innovative agency-specific solutions. It&rsquo;s about applying the systematic thinking that made 1960s federal design legendary to support and amplify today&rsquo;s digital innovations. Just as NASA&rsquo;s visual standards enabled clear communication across complex missions, coordinated design principles could help today&rsquo;s talented government design teams achieve even greater impact.</p>

<p>A new era of government design excellence would prioritize:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typography</strong>: Optimized for digital readability across devices and accessibility needs</li>
<li><strong>Spacing</strong>: Systematic and purposeful, creating clear information hierarchies</li>
<li><strong>Color</strong>: Functional and accessible, meeting WCAG standards while maintaining visual coherence</li>
<li><strong>Interaction patterns</strong>: Consistent, learnable behaviors that work across all government services</li>
<li><strong>Content strategy</strong>: Clear, plain-language communication that puts citizen needs first</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Fast, reliable experiences that work on any device or connection speed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-promise-of-systematic-design">The Promise of Systematic Design<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-promise-of-systematic-design">#</a></h3>
<p>Imagine if interacting with government services felt as intuitive and efficient as the design systems that guided America to the moon. Citizens could focus on their goals rather than deciphering interfaces. Government agencies could build on shared foundations to focus resources on their unique missions and specialized user needs. This collaborative approach could amplify the excellent work already happening across government, helping America become known for digital services that combine beauty with unprecedented functionality.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-next">#</a></h3>
<p>In the next installment of this series, I&rsquo;ll explore concrete strategies for implementing a unified government design system that honors the best of our design heritage while meeting the demands of digital citizenship. We&rsquo;ll examine how systematic design thinking can reduce costs, improve accessibility, and restore citizen confidence in government digital services.</p>
