Theming allows the design system to be flexible and adaptable, providing a seamless experience for users across different products. Here’s how it works:\nProduct-Specific Views: Users can toggle between different products within the system, switching the theme to match the selected product. Components for that brand could be seen when selected. Selecting the see all option would show all components from every product.\nConsistent Experience Across Products: While each product has its own unique branding and design elements, the underlying structure of the design system remains consistent. This means that whether a designer is working on Product A or Product B, they are using the same core system components, ensuring a cohesive experience across all products.\nToken structure Having a token library helps create a single source of truth for colors and styles. Having consistent naming for each product ensure the token switching remains consistent.\nThis theming solution allowed us to maintain a unified design system that could serve multiple products while respecting each product’s individual branding requirements.\nNote: Below is an example of the solution we implemented where the theme of the component can be changed depending on the option selected. This example was generated using Claude and added to CodePen.\nSee the Pen CodePen Demo by babsdenney on CodePen. Key Benefits of the Theming Solution Scalability: The theming approach made the design system more scalable, enabling us to easily add new products in the future without overhauling the entire system.\nConsistency: By standardizing the underlying components and guidelines, we ensured that all products maintained a consistent user experience, even as their visual identities varied.\nEfficiency: Designers and developers could focus on building and maintaining one design system rather than creating separate systems for each product, saving time and reducing complexity.\nConclusion Expanding a design system to support multiple products presents unique challenges, but it also offers opportunities for increased efficiency, consistency, and scalability. By implementing a theming solution, we were able to adapt our design system to meet the needs of multiple products while preserving the integrity of the overall system.
