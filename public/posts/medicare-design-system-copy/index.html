Sometimes the contractor wins the rebid, but sometimes a new contractor wins. This causes whole parts of the product to change hands. Everyone from managers to engineers leaves the product, and another team moves in.\nApproval red tape. Government websites can be slow to change and get approval for the change. Finding ways to improve efficiency might be easy but slow to implement. Many government products are still adapting to a more agile way of production. Unique business requirements. One of the few products on the internet that is greatly connected to what is going on in Congress. When new bills are passed, those create new requirements for the website that can create business requirements that aren’t always the most usable solutions for users. Adapting and constantly accommodating these new changes can create hurdles and road bumps in an otherwise clear path.\nThe different issues are all great reasons to establish a design system. Design systems can help solve all these issues by creating a single source of truth for all involved. Whether you are a contractor onboarding onto the product or a stakeholder trying to understand a unique page pattern, a design system will help you find guidance. A design system can help establish the consistency and documentation that all government websites need.\nBackground The Medicare website was going through a significant change. Medicare stakeholders boldly moved to redesign the entire Medicare website from scratch. New technologies, new processes, new product teams, and new branding. The redesign of the Medicare website was completed incrementally, where portions of the website would change to the new design at different times. I was on a team responsible for one of the first parts of the product to be redesigned. I worked on a team as a Designer that was responsible for designing the user experience for enrolling in Medicare Advantage plans. We worked with Medicare stakeholders to design the UI kit and ensure that the final design was developed in the styles and new brand colors created and approved for the new Medicare experience. Everything was going great until we got feedback from the stakeholders that part of the website looked different than another contracting team’s product, which was also being redesigned at a pace a few months behind ours. Since both teams’ products are still in testing environments, we were unaware of this other contracting team’s product and vice versa. When we eventually did get access to this other team’s testing environment, we quickly realized that their product did look different from ours. Even though we were both given the same UI kit, this other team used that kit differently, and in the end, these two products looked very different. We had to figure out how to get into alignment. This began a considerable process of who should change what and how we align the different sections going forward. This was when we started to think about a Design System. A shared resource that all the contracting teams can go to get alignment on design and guidance. Problems and solutions Stakeholder buy-in Convincing stakeholders to start a design system can be challenging and incredibly challenging on a government contract. Each team is focused on its contractual obligations and is not focused on what other teams are doing. If a design system were going to be established, it would have to start with the stakeholders. There are a few reasons for this:\nFull view of the product The stakeholders are the only ones with a complete 360 view of what is going on with teams. They see the issues that we are facing now.\nChange in the contract needs The stakeholders are the only ones that can make contract amendments. Going to the team’s product managers and asking them to use a design system or contribute to the design system would be immediately faced with “we can’t work on this right now.”\nDesign system champions It is essential to create design system champions when establishing a design system. Getting stakeholder buy-in was a slow process. Some of the efforts we used to get buy-in were:\nPresentations that showed the specific ways the design system would improve the consistency issues that Medicare leadership was seeing and steps you could take to start a design system. This is something I think was important. There are many articles on the web that can show the benefits of the design system, but showing the specific ways they can benefit Medicare helps create reference. Taking ownership of the problem helped create momentum. Presenting the problem was only part of the solution, and persistently making progress on figuring out a solution helped get stakeholder buy-in and create a path toward the design system becoming a realization. This persistent progress took many forms. MVP for a design system. We created a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for what a Design System could look like. We looked at a 3rd party solution using an Invision product or a custom doc site created in-house. Both options had pros and cons, but seeing it as an actual product helped stakeholders see the vision of a design system and the benefits. Communication Communication can be a problem in many products and always needs focus. As stated above, the way contracts are created in government contracts kind of sows silos into the contracts. Working with different teams that have no incentive to work together. Quite the opposite, where working together might give away secrets on rebids and show weaknesses within team internal processes. Here are some of the initiatives we started to help remove some of the silos between the teams.\nStarting a tiger team. This might have been the single best thing we could have done. We asked that one Designer from each team come together to solve design systems issues, become aligned on design decisions, and communicate in a way that hadn’t been done before. It was more than just a group of designers; it was also a team-building exercise where designers became comfortable working together to solve issues. We met every 2 weeks and reviewed different components and styles to align on consistency. Design System Sprint While the tiger team helped tackle design system issues, the stakeholders thought it was going too slow and wanted to speed up the results, which was great to hear. I discuss this more in a separate article.\nWorkshops We conducted workshops that consisted of auditing components within Medicare, retrpospective to improve processes, and feedback when starting to implement components into the design system. While the outcome of the workshops were important and we received some great feedback, this was also a helpful team building exercise where teams were able to connect and communicate freely with each other. Team adoption This is a constant challenge for most design systems, and our product is no different. You have a lot of teams going in different directions and focuses. Everyone is trying to accomplish their objectives. Then, you throw a design system into the mix and ask teams to commit to contributing and using a design system that will change their processes and take time away from their goals. It’s going to be a rough go. Here are some things we are doing to improve team adoption and contribution.\nTiger team, I have mentioned this before. Still, it was pivotal in creating design system champions and getting a pulse on what designers are implementing and what they need in a design system. Squeaky wheel This isn’t my strong suit, but I took it every time I was allowed to discuss the design system. This meant making presentations on the updates, discussing new components to be implemented, and asking stakeholders for approval on different guidance sections. Beginning with buttons. Beginning with buttons was a great option to prevent being overwhelmed by the process and to get a minimum viable product out. When you are starting a design system, most of the advice out there says to audit your entire site and then add those components to your design system. There always seems to be a considerable gap in the middle part of creating the assets, creating the process, writing the guidance, getting stakeholder approval, and implementing. While we did try to start this endeavor by doing a site-wide audit, it kind of fizzled out. Getting everyone on board with final designs and approval from stakeholders is a huge endeavor. Instead, starting with buttons helped us iron out the details of processes, button designs, and stakeholder approval. Asking teams to implement and adopt a design system that only has buttons is much easier than adding a bunch of other components to the mix. Once you have teams that have added the design system to their repo, other changes become much more manageable. Working on buttons from design to implementation before focusing on other components helped create attainable goals that leadership could get behind.\nStakeholder approval All these steps helped, but it comes to ensuring the stakeholders are leading the way and requesting teams to adopt the design system. This is an ongoing process of ensuring the stakeholders are satisfied with their commitment to a design system. I wrote an article on design systems metrics showing the value of the design system is essential to its longevity and continued commitment. Lessons learned I wrote this blog post that reflects on the best tips and ideas for starting the Medicare Design System. Process over product The biggest lesson learned when creating the design system is that the processes you establish are just as or even more important than the actual Design System. Having a design system and having a design system that is used are two very different things. Thinking about the process for contribution, communication, and updates is what keeps a design system alive and should be a large focus of a design system designer’s time. Keeping the design system relevant is a team effort that all teams should be a part of and you are the person that keeps teams connected to the design system.\nContribution is key No matter what team structure you have set up for your design system, having others contribute back to the design system is still important. It might be just some feedback from team or it could be whole components. Making design system ownership a group activity helps create a feeling of ownership which helps keep the design system alive. Starting small Design systems should be a continuous process of contribution and at the beginning, it might look pretty humble and unimpressive but the important part is that you know all the ins and outs of the design system process and all the teams are using the button. ",

<p>Convincing stakeholders to start a design system can be challenging and incredibly challenging on a government contract. Each team is focused on its contractual obligations and is not focused on what other teams are doing. If a design system were going to be established, it would have to start with the stakeholders. There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full view of the product</strong>  The stakeholders are the only ones with a complete 360 view of what is going on with teams. They see the issues that we are facing now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change in the contract needs</strong>  The stakeholders are the only ones that can make contract amendments. Going to the team&rsquo;s product managers and asking them to use a design system or contribute to the design system would be immediately faced with “we can’t work on this right now.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design system champions</strong> It is essential to create design system champions when establishing a design system. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting stakeholder buy-in was a slow process. Some of the efforts we used to get buy-in were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong> that showed the specific ways the design system would improve the consistency issues that Medicare leadership was seeing and steps you could take to start a design system. This is something I think was important. There are many articles on the web that can show the benefits of the design system, but showing the specific ways they can benefit Medicare helps create reference. </p>

<p><strong>Taking ownership of the problem</strong> helped create momentum. Presenting the problem was only part of the solution, and persistently making progress on figuring out a solution helped get stakeholder buy-in and create a path toward the design system becoming a realization. This persistent progress took many forms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MVP for a design system</strong>. We created a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for what a Design System could look like. We looked at a 3rd party solution using an Invision product or a custom doc site created in-house. Both options had pros and cons, but seeing it as an actual product helped stakeholders see the vision of a design system and the benefits. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="communication">Communication<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#communication">#</a></h2>
<p>Communication can be a problem in many products and always needs focus. As stated above, the way contracts are created in government contracts kind of sows silos into the contracts. Working with different teams that have no incentive to work together. Quite the opposite, where working together might give away secrets on rebids and show weaknesses within team internal processes.  Here are some of the initiatives we started to help remove some of the silos between the teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Starting a tiger team.</strong> This might have been the single best thing we could have done. We asked that one Designer from each team come together to solve design systems issues, become aligned on design decisions, and communicate in a way that hadn’t been done before. It was more than just a group of designers; it was also a team-building exercise where designers became comfortable working together to solve issues. We met every 2 weeks and reviewed different components and styles to align on consistency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design System Sprint</strong> While the tiger team helped tackle design system issues, the stakeholders thought it was going too slow and wanted to speed up the results, which was great to hear. I discuss this more in a separate article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workshops</strong> We conducted workshops that consisted of auditing components within Medicare, retrpospective to improve processes, and feedback when starting to implement components into the design system. While the outcome of the workshops were important and we received some great feedback, this was also a helpful team building exercise where teams were able to connect and communicate freely with each other. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="team-adoption">Team adoption<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#team-adoption">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a constant challenge for most design systems, and our product is no different. You have a lot of teams going in different directions and focuses. Everyone is trying to accomplish their objectives. Then, you throw a design system into the mix and ask teams to commit to contributing and using a design system that will change their processes and take time away from their goals. It’s going to be a rough go. Here are some things we are doing to improve team adoption and contribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tiger team</strong>, I have mentioned this before. Still, it was pivotal in creating design system champions and getting a pulse on what designers are implementing and what they need in a design system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Squeaky wheel</strong> This isn’t my strong suit, but I took it every time I was allowed to discuss the design system. This meant making presentations on the updates, discussing new components to be implemented, and asking stakeholders for approval on different guidance sections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beginning with buttons.</strong> Beginning with buttons was a great option to prevent being overwhelmed by the process and to get a minimum viable product out. When you are starting a design system, most of the advice out there says to audit your entire site and then add those components to your design system. There always seems to be a considerable gap in the middle part of creating the assets, creating the process, writing the guidance, getting stakeholder approval, and implementing. While we did try to start this endeavor by doing a site-wide audit, it kind of fizzled out. Getting everyone on board with final designs and approval from stakeholders is a huge endeavor. Instead, starting with buttons helped us iron out the details of processes, button designs, and stakeholder approval. Asking teams to implement and adopt a design system that only has buttons is much easier than adding a bunch of other components to the mix. Once you have teams that have added the design system to their repo, other changes become much more manageable. Working on buttons from design to implementation before focusing on other components helped create attainable goals that leadership could get behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stakeholder approval</strong> All these steps helped, but it comes to ensuring the stakeholders are leading the way and requesting teams to adopt the design system. This is an ongoing process of ensuring the stakeholders are satisfied with their commitment to a design system. I wrote an article on design systems metrics showing the value of the design system is essential to its longevity and continued commitment. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lessons-learned">#</a></h1>
<p>I wrote this blog post that reflects on the best tips and ideas for starting the Medicare Design System. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process over product</strong> The biggest lesson learned when creating the design system is that the processes you establish are just as or even more important than the actual Design System. Having a design system and having a design system that is used are two very different things. Thinking about the process for contribution, communication, and updates is what keeps a design system alive and should be a large focus of a design system designer&rsquo;s time. Keeping the design system relevant is a team effort that all teams should be a part of and you are the person that keeps teams connected to the design system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contribution is key</strong> No matter what team structure you have set up for your design system, having others contribute back to the design system is still important. It might be just some feedback from team or it could be whole components. Making design system ownership a group activity helps create a feeling of ownership which helps keep the design system alive. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Starting small</strong> Design systems should be a continuous process of contribution and at the beginning, it might look pretty humble and unimpressive but the important part is that you know all the ins and outs of the design system process and all the teams are using the button. </p>
</li>
</ul>
