Designers and developers may never interact with their counterparts on parallel teams. The lack of shared tools or processes makes it difficult to sync on decisions and styles. How We Tackled It 1. The Tiger Team\nWe established a “tiger team” that had one dedicated designer from each product team tasked with resolving design system issues and aligning on design decisions. This wasn’t just a working group; it became a space for trust-building. Meeting biweekly, this team reviewed components and collaborated on solutions.\n2. Design System Sprint\nOnce the tiger team was functioning well, leadership wanted to accelerate results. We launched a focused design system sprint. The sprint fast-tracked alignment by setting clear, short-term goals and concentrating full team efforts on shared outcomes.\n3. Workshops\nWe ran workshops for design audits, process retrospectives, and implementation planning. These sessions not only yielded useful feedback but also strengthened bonds between team members who rarely had the chance to collaborate directly.\nKey Takeaway Communication wasn’t just about Slack messages or meetings. It was about creating shared rituals and safe spaces to solve problems together. Breaking down silos required more than process. It needed a people-first approach.\nNote: This article was co-written with the help of AI to improve clarity and structure.\n",
