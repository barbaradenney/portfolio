&lt;p>Tabs can be deceptively simple, but under the surface they come with complex usability and accessibility considerations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the key issues you need to solve when creating tabs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What happens when tabs exceed the width of the screen?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should tabs work as in-page navigation or update the URL?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do we support users at 400% zoom or on screens narrower than 320px?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="exploring-overflow-solutions">Exploring Overflow Solutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We considered three possible options for the tab overflow design. Each option had trade-offs depending on content density, accessibility, and implementation constraints.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experimenting with Annotation Mode in Figma</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/figma-annotation-mode-experiment-design-systems-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:15:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/figma-annotation-mode-experiment-design-systems-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our design team recently began exploring a new way to annotate designs directly in Figma. While searching for examples of this technique online, we came up short, which made us wonder if other teams were thinking about this the same way we were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Figma already supports switching between properties using &lt;strong>modes&lt;/strong> which is great for themes like light/dark mode or responsive layouts. We started thinking, could we use modes to annotate?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflection on Early Lessons</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-operational-processes-sustainability-reflection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:30:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-operational-processes-sustainability-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="looking-back-on-hard-won-lessons">Looking Back on Hard-Won Lessons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A few years ago, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://adhoc.team/2022/07/18/using-design-systems-digital-success-federal-space/">blog post&lt;/a> reflecting on the early lessons from establishing a new design system. The big ideas I shared that focused on creating alignment, scaling consistency, and building shared patterns remain as relevant as ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But with more experience under my belt, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand that &lt;strong>operational processes&lt;/strong> are the invisible foundation that determines whether a design system thrives or slowly deteriorates. These can be considered Design System operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Scalable Design System: Integrating Multiple Products</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/building-scalable-design-system-multiple-products-theming-approach/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:45:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/building-scalable-design-system-multiple-products-theming-approach/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="problem-multiple-products-one-system">Problem: Multiple Products, One System&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The current design system I was working on had been created for a single product and we now needed to update the design system to support more products. Expanding it required rethinking how we could serve multiple brands under one umbrella. The new design system would have to allow unique guidance, components, and design resources for multiple products without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution-a-theming-approach-to-product-diversity">The Solution: A Theming Approach to Product Diversity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To solve this challenge, we implemented a theming solution. Theming allows the design system to be flexible and adaptable, providing a seamless experience for users across different products. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design System Series: Part 5 – Lessons Learned from Starting a Design System</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part5-lessons-learned-starting-design-system/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 09:20:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part5-lessons-learned-starting-design-system/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>After months of collaboration, testing, and iteration, the design system had grown from a simple idea into an adopted framework across multiple teams. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always a smooth journey. Like most large initiatives, it came with important lessons, some expected and many surprising.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design System Series: Part 4 – Driving Team Adoption</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part4-driving-team-adoption-strategies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 15:10:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part4-driving-team-adoption-strategies/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Even with strong leadership support and cross-team communication in place, getting individual teams to adopt the design system is an entirely different challenge. Each team has their own roadmap, their own deadlines, and often their own way of doing things. Adoption requires time, effort, and a shift in mindset, and none of that happens by accident.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design System Series: Part 3 – Breaking Down Silos Through Communication</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part3-breaking-silos-team-communication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part3-breaking-silos-team-communication/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>Once stakeholder buy-in was secured, the next big challenge was building bridges between siloed teams. In large organizations or government contracts, teams often operate in isolation with little incentive (and sometimes active disincentives) to share information. This makes cross-functional alignment incredibly difficult.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design System Series: Part 2 – Gaining Stakeholder Buy-In</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part2-gaining-stakeholder-buy-in-government/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 08:45:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part2-gaining-stakeholder-buy-in-government/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>One of the most critical steps in establishing a design system, especially within a government contract or large organization, is gaining stakeholder buy-in. Without it, a design system risks being sidelined as &amp;ldquo;extra work&amp;rdquo; instead of being seen as an essential part of product development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design System Series: Part 1 – Why We Built It</title><link>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part1-why-we-built-government-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 14:30:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://barbaradenney.github.io/posts/design-system-series-part1-why-we-built-government-website/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>The client’s website was undergoing a bold redesign: new tech, new processes, new branding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, things were going well until we learned another team’s redesign (still in testing) looked very different, despite being based on the same kit. This discrepancy highlighted the need for a &lt;strong>shared resource&lt;/strong>: a Design System.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
