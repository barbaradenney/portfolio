One of the most critical steps in establishing a design system, especially within a government contract or large organization, is gaining stakeholder buy-in. Without it, a design system risks being sidelined as "extra work" instead of being seen as an essential part of product development.

## Why Stakeholder Buy-in Matter

- **They have the full view.** Stakeholders are often the only people who understand the broader context across teams. They can see the inconsistencies and inefficiencies that arise when every team works in silos.
- **They control contracts.** In government environments, no team can pivot to prioritize a design system unless stakeholders authorize and fund that effort.
- **They create momentum.** Stakeholder champions become advocates for adoption, ensuring the design system isn’t just a good idea, but a priority.

## How We Got Buy-In

1. **Show, don’t just tell.** We created presentations specifically showing how a design system would directly address the inconsistency issues leadership had already identified. 

2. **Own the problem.** Rather than just identifying a lack of alignment, we actively started exploring solutions. This persistence in trying to solve the problem signaled to leadership that we were serious.

3. **Build an MVP.** We developed a simple, minimum viable product of what a design system might look like. Having something tangible helped stakeholders visualize the value.

Getting buy-in didn’t happen overnight. But with consistency, clear examples, and solution-driven energy, we got the support we needed to move forward.

With stakeholders on board our next step was to get other teams to buy-in.
