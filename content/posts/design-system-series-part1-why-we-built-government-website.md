## Background

The client’s website was undergoing a bold redesign: new tech, new processes, new branding.

Initially, things were going well until we learned another team’s redesign (still in testing) looked very different, despite being based on the same kit. This discrepancy highlighted the need for a **shared resource**: a Design System.

This was our turning point. Not just a visual mismatch, but a systemic need for alignment.

## Overview
Government contracting, in general, can pose many unique challenges regarding communication and alignment when building a product.

- **Communication silos.** Due to multiple contractors working on the same website, communication silos are inevitable. Contracting teams are not incentivized to share information due to the focus on contract rebids.
- **Onboarding overhead.** Many contracts are set up to be rebid every few years. Sometimes the contractor wins the rebid, but sometimes a new contractor wins. This causes whole parts of the product to change hands. Everyone from managers to engineers leaves the product, and another team moves in.
- **Approval red tape.** Government websites can be slow to change and get approval for the change. Finding ways to improve efficiency might be easy but slow to implement.
- **Unique business requirements.** New bills passed in Congress can directly impact product requirements, often leading to non-user-centric designs that must be adapted quickly.

The solution? A **design system**. It provides a single source of truth, aligns stakeholders, and fosters consistency.

Confident with our solution to increase consistency with the rebranded website, our next focus was to get stakholder approval.
