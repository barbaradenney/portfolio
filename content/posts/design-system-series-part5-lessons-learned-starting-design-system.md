After months of collaboration, testing, and iteration, the design system had grown from a simple idea into an adopted framework across multiple teams. But it wasn't always a smooth journey. Like most large initiatives, it came with important lessons, some expected and many surprising.

Here are the most valuable takeaways from the experience:

## 1. Process Over Product

Having a design system is not enough. Having one that is **used** is what matters. And usage is driven by the processes you put in place: contribution models, communication loops, approval structures, and consistent engagement.

A beautiful Figma file means nothing if no one knows how to access, implement, or update it.

## 2. Contribution is Critical

Even if your design system starts with a centralized team, it won’t scale without contributions from others. Whether it's offering feedback, suggesting new components, or improving documentation, inviting contributions gives teams a sense of **ownership**. And ownership is what keeps a system alive.

## 3. Start Small

We learned this the hard way. Auditing the entire site upfront is a heavy lift and easy to stall. Starting with buttons gave us a manageable goal and the space to refine our process. From there, we could expand in a controlled, thoughtful way.

## 4. Communicate Constantly

From workshops to sprint demos to Slack threads, frequent and transparent communication made the system feel like a shared initiative instead of a side project. Creating rituals around communication kept it visible and made adoption feel natural.

## 5. Celebrate the Wins

Highlighting when a team implements a component, contributes guidance, or improves the system goes a long way. Small celebrations keep the energy up and help people feel like they’re part of something meaningful.

## Final Thoughts

A design system is never "done". It evolves with the product, the people, and the organization. But if there's one lesson that stood above the rest, it's this: **a successful design system is less about the components and more about the community behind it.**

Thanks for reading this series. If you're building a design system, especially in a complex or government environment, I hope these posts help you feel seen and maybe even a little more equipped.
