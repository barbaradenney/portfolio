## Looking Back on Hard-Won Lessons

A few years ago, I wrote a [blog post](https://adhoc.team/2022/07/18/using-design-systems-digital-success-federal-space/) reflecting on the early lessons from establishing a new design system. The big ideas I shared then—creating alignment, scaling consistency, building shared patterns—remain as relevant as ever.

But with more experience under my belt, I've come to understand that **operational processes** are the invisible foundation that determines whether a design system thrives or slowly deteriorates.

## The Operational Layer That Changes Everything

Here's what I've learned about the unglamorous but critical processes that make design systems sustainable:

### Support Infrastructure
**Help desk workflows** became essential as adoption grew. We standardized our issue tracking through GitHub—every request, bug report, and question gets documented. This creates accountability and helps us spot patterns in user needs.

**Governance** Having a dedicated review process to make sure teams are following guidelines and using the correct components is a helpful process that acts as checks and balances for the Design System. Sometimes the governance team finds places where further guidance and clarification is needed. Other times the governance teams uses the design system to verify teams are implementing 

**Design System Council**

### Documented Processes
Small, repeatable workflows prevent chaos: 
- **Icon additions**: A clear approval process prevents icon bloat and maintains visual consistency
- **Token management**: Structured approaches to spacing, color, and typography tokens prevent design drift across teams
- **Release documentation**: Even minor updates deserve release notes—transparency builds trust
- **Figma publishing**: We established regular publishing schedules with quality checklists to ensure smooth designer handoffs
- **Contribution pathways**: Open contribution processes transform users into stakeholders and collaborators
- **Change communication**: Strategic announcements, demos, and proactive Slack updates keep the system visible and relevant

## Final Thought

The core lesson? A great design system isn’t just about components—it’s about the systems that support the system.
