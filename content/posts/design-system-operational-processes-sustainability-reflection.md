## Revisiting a Past Post

One of my goals a few years ago was to write a blog post about the lessons I learned while helping to establish a new design system. Now that I’ve been working on design systems for a while, I’ve had the opportunity to reflect on what still rings true—and what I’d update.

The original post focused on big-picture ideas: creating alignment, scaling consistency, and the power of shared patterns. All of that still holds up. But I’ve since realized that it’s the **operational layer**—the repeatable processes—that really make a design system sustainable.

## What I’d Add Today

The details matter. Here are a few areas where operationalizing the design system added significant value:

- **Adding icons**: Having a documented flow for when and how new icons are introduced helps avoid clutter and keeps things predictable.
- **Adding tokens**: Whether for spacing, color, or typography, consistent token management reduces drift across teams.
- **Release notes**: Publishing updates, no matter how small, makes sure that teams stay informed and trust the system.
- **Publishing to Figma**: Smooth integration with design tools helps adoption. We created a defined publishing schedule and checklist.
- **Contribution process**: It’s not a design system if it’s a black box. Clear contribution paths turn users into collaborators.
- **Communication of changes**: Announcements, demos, and even Slack reminders help keep the system alive.

## Final Thought

The core lesson? A great design system isn’t just about components—it’s about the systems that support the system.
