## Looking Back—and Forward

Figma just went public, and it’s a reminder of how dominant the tool has become in the design world. Our team switched to Figma last year and immediately saw huge improvements in collaboration, consistency, and speed. We were late adopters, but happy ones.

It also got me thinking—what comes next?

## From Photoshop to Prompts

When I started in design, the primary tool was Adobe Photoshop. Then came Sketch, which offered web-focused workflows. Then Figma brought it all to the cloud, at the perfect moment for remote work. It felt like a natural evolution.

But now we’re at another inflection point: **AI-powered design tools**.

Platforms like **V0** and **Luvable** let you build working prototypes with a simple prompt. **Magic Patterns** is evolving quickly, offering coded components instead of static mockups. The gap between design and production is shrinking—and tools like these are accelerating that shift.

## Can Figma Keep Up?

Figma has made some moves into dev mode, but many of these AI tools are fundamentally rethinking how design gets done. Rather than relying on mockups, they’re aiming for **live, coded prototypes** that are testable, adjustable, and faster to ship.

And that’s the big question: Can Figma evolve fast enough to meet the expectations of the AI era?

## The Opportunity

I don’t think Figma disappears—but I do think we’ll see workflows shift away from static pixel-perfect files and toward **code-adjacent prototypes**.

Designers should prepare for this future by:
- Learning how AI tools fit into your current stack
- Experimenting with coded prototypes
- Focusing less on perfect screens, and more on fast iterations

The next chapter in design might not look like a canvas at all.
