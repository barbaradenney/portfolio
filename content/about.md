For the past five years, I have had the privilege of working on design systems and I truly enjoy the craft. From helping to establish new systems to maintaining and evolving mature ones, there is always something fresh and intriguing to explore. Lately, I have been diving into the world of AI, discovering how it can enhance efficiency, improve consistency, and open new creative possibilities.

I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado and enjoy illustrating and running.
