I started my career as a Web Designer 20 years ago making computer based training modules in Flash, moved into UX converting desktop applications to cloud-based ones, and currently help support design systems. Now, the next new shift in technology has begun and we are now all trying to figure out how AI will transform the web as we use it today. 

I currently reside in Colorado Springs, Colorado and enjoy doodling and running.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### 2023: Moving a design system component library from react to web components
- **Description**: Assisted team with moving the entire component library from React to Web components as well as moving from Sketch to Figma.

### 2021: Merging design systems
